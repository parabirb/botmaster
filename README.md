# botmaster
i got too mad trying to play wordle so i made this instead. it probably works? it's probably inefficient? i'm lazy? i don't care about how inefficient it is?

## usage
~~dependencies???? haha no i like going insane~~ i wrote this code (including the readme) months ago and forgot to mention if you want to use the word master TAS tool, you need `readline-sync`. also, for input, you need to input whatever word master outputs (0 = gray, 1 = yellow, 2 = green). as an example, if the result of the first word (raise) was all green, i'd enter `22222`. 

just do `npm test` to test it out or something idk
